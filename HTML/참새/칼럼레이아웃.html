            A lot of people, especially young people, go through the day without having breakfast.
            Many people believe that it is not necessary, or they say that they don’t have time for
            that, and begin their day with no meal. I believe that everyone should eat breakfast
            before going to their activities. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of
            breakfast, especially for students. THESIS STATEMENT
            The first reason why you should eat breakfast before going to school is for your
            health. When you skip breakfast and go to school, you are looking for a disease because
            it’s not healthy to have an empty stomach all day long. It’s very important to have a
            meal and not let your stomach work empty. All you are going to get is gastritis and a lot
            of problems with your health if you don’t eat breakfast.
            Another reason for eating breakfast is because you need food for to do well in
            your classes. You body and your brain are not going to function as good as they could
            because you have no energy and no strength. When you try to learn something and have
            nothing in your stomach, you are going to have a lot of trouble succeeding. A lot of
            people think that they should not eat because they are going to feel tired, but that’s not
            true. Breakfast is not a very big meal, and on the contrary, you’re going to feel tired if
            you don’t have breakfast because you have spent the entire previous night without
            food.
